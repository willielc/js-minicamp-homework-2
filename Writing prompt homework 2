For

“For” loop is a set of instructions that the program executes multiple times until the 
condition that you set has been net, then it will exit your loop and move to the next line 
of code.


&&, ||, !

“&&” is an operator that you use to compare 2 conditions in your statement, and if BOTH 
conditions are met, you condition is assigned the value “true”, and it will execute the 
lines of codes that comes after.  If one of the conditions is not met, then the value 
becomes “false”, and it will skip the lines of codes within your statement.

“||” is an operator used to compare 2 conditions, and if EITHER ONE or BOTH conditions are 
met, the condition is assigned the value of “true” and the lines of codes are executed. If 
neither of the conditions are met, the value is “false”.

“!” is an operator to assign the opposite value of the condition.  It returns “true” if the 
condition is false, and “false” if the condition is true.


Arrays

An array is a variable which you can assign multiple values or items like a list.  It is 
assigned with values using “[ ]” and each value is separated by a comma.


Git

Git is an application that you install in your computer to write and edit programming codes
that you can share in cloud services.  This application allows you to write your own version 
of your codes before you share it with others.


GitHub

GitHub is an online site where you can collaborate with other people with your programming 
codes.  It allows people to share their own version of the program that you are all working 
on.  There will be a primary owner (master) of the codes that you all work on, and he/she 
will maintain the main copy of the codes.  You and others can copy, review, edit or make 
changes to those versions of the files that you have copied, while keeping the master copy 
intact without changes, until the primary owner decides to.
